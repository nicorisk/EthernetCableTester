# EthernetCableTester
I made this project for school (HEH.be), not much but it was fun.

The code is meant to be injected on a PIC16F628A, and if you plan on injecting this code to make your own cable tester, then you should follow the schematics that is provided.
Anyone can use this code for free, make changes, add features, but I remain the owner of it.


Pictures of the CableTester to be added soon.
