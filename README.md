# EthernetCableTester
Made my own ethernet cable tester as part of a school project involving :
- Designing a working PCB using Autodesk Eagle and EasyEDA.
- Coding the whole thing in C language in order to control the PIC using MikroC and MikroC Suite for PIC.
- Injecting the .hex file compiled into the microchip using a PICkit3
- Soldering components to the PCB
